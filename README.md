Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, AIDS, is a widespread virus that is highly prevalent in today’s society. Understanding its effects is extremely important for public health officials in regards to planning resources towards prevention research, disease control, and public assistance. While no cure exists, many treatments are being tested in an attempt to slow the disease’s progress or nullify its effects.

The experiment was a randomized, double-blind study of AIDS patients with advanced immune suppression, that corresponds to CD4 counts of less than or equal to 50 cells/mm3.

1309 patients were randomized to be administered four different daily treatments of medication called Zidovudine. The four treatments are as follows:

Treatment 1: zidovudine alternating monthly with 400mg didanosine  
Treatment 2: zidovudine plus 2.25mg of zalcitabine  
Treatment 3: zidovudine plus 400mg of didanosine  
Treatment 4: zidovudine plus 400mg of didanosine plus 400mg of nevirapine  

The variables of interest are listed below:
log_CD4: log transformed CD4 counts (log(CD4 + 1))
Week: time since baseline (weeks)
Age: age of subject (years)
Gender: male and female

Our goal is to compare the effect of treatment types on the changes in both log transformed CD4 and CD4 counts over time.
